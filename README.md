**Next Action: Try to add JS**

- 2021-06-30: I've got a nice little display that shows history.  I need to figure out how to handle clear events.  Also double ops
- 2021-06-28: I can now accept decimals and clear.  I would like to make the display better.
- 2021-06-27: Basic calculator is working for whole numbers.  I need to fix it let it accept decimals
- 2021-06-20: I was able to build the calculator skeleton and build the basic JS functions.
